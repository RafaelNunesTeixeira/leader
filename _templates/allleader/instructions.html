        Instructions

    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants.
        You are going to play with the same group for {{Constants.rounds}} rounds.
        The group is composed of <strong>{{player.galera}}</strong>. You assume the role of <strong> {{player.role}} </strong> in your group.

    </p>
        <p></p>
    <p>
        Each participant in the group starts each round with 20 points.
        The group has the opportunity to undertake a joint project.
        The joint project consists of two stages:
    </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        FIRST STAGE:
            Each participant in the group decides how many points to contribute to the project.
            A contribution could be any whole number from 0 to 20.
            Each 1 point contributed to the project is multiplied by {{ Constants.multiplier }}.
            The result of the project is the sum of contribution given by all group members multiplied by the {{ Constants.multiplier }}.
            Then the result of the project is <strong>evenly split among all</strong> {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants:
            {{player.galera}}. The points not contributed to the project are also kept by the participants.

        </li>
            <br>
            <p>Your payoff from the first stage is therefore: </p>
            <center>(Payoff STAGE 1) = (20 – your contribution to the project) +  <sup>1.5 &times(total contribution to the project)</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
</center>
            <br>

        <li>
        SECOND STAGE:
            The participants see each other's contributions to the project.
            At this stage, you can choose to distribute punishment points to each of the other particants, or not
            The other participants can also choose distribute punishment points to you, if they wish to.
            You can distribute from 0 to 10 punishment points to all other participants.
            Each punishment point that you distribute to another participant reduces your payoff by 1 point
            and reduces the other participant's payoff by {{ Constants.punmulti }} points.
            Similarly, your payoff is reduced by 2 points for every point the other group members distribute to you.
        </li>

            <br><p>Your total payoff in a round is then:</p>
<center>Total Payoff = (Payoff STAGE 1) – (punishment points you give) – 2  &times (punishment points you get) </center>

<br><p>The payoff of the other participants are calculated in the same way.</p>

        </ul>
