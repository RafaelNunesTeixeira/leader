        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group of 3 participants.
        You are going to play with the same group for {{Constants.rounds}} rounds.
        The group is composed of <strong>{{player.participant.gal}}</strong>. Your role in the group will be informed soon, when the other members of the group join the experiment.

    </p>
        <p></p>
    <p>
        Each participant in the group starts each round with 20 points.
        The group has the opportunity to undertake a joint project.
    </p>
        <p>
        In the joint project, each participant in the group decides how many points to contribute into it.
            A contribution could be any whole number from 0 to 20.
            Each 1 point contributed to the project is multiplied by {{ Constants.multiplier }}.
            The result of the project is the sum of contribution given by all group members multiplied by the {{ Constants.multiplier }}.
            Then the result of the project is <strong>evenly split among all</strong> 3 participants:
            {{player.participant.gal}}. The points not contributed to the project are also kept by the participants and count to the final earnings.

        </p>

            <p>Thus, your total earnings from project in each round is determined by: </p>
            <center>Total earnings = (20 â€“ your contribution to the project) +  <sup>1.5 &times(total contribution to the project)</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
</center>



<br><p> Your earnings in the experiment is the sum of your points in all rounds. The earnings of all other participants are calculated in the same way.</p>
